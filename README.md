## Technology Used
- Programming Language - Python

1. Compute Instance 
2. BigQuery
3. S3


Modern Data Pipeine Tool - https://www.mage.ai/

## Dataset Used
TLC Trip Record Data
Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. 

Here is the dataset used: https://github.com/HassanAlIdroos/taxi-data-engineering/blob/main/Data/taxi_data.csv
